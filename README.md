# String Library

This library is meant to be an extremely simple and easy-to-use string library
for C programs. It consists of only one file, `pmk_string.h` which should
compile with GCC, clang, and MSVC.

For more detailed documentation, refer to the opening comments in
`pmk_string.h`. For example usage, see `examples.c`

To compile and run the examples under Linux:

```
make run
```

Or on Windows using MSVC:

```
build
```
